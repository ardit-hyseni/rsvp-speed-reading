Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, or RSVP for short, is a cool technique used to show people information really fast—one item at a time—in the same spot on the screen. 
Instead of reading a whole paragraph at your own pace, words (or images) flash by quickly, usually in the center of your vision. 
It’s kind of like speed reading: the content moves, not your eyes. This makes it easier to process info without having to scroll or move your gaze around.
